## CalciDB

CalciDB is a database management system built with Python, SQLAlchemy, and AI integration. It aims to simplify user interaction with a SQLite database by providing seamless operations for data modeling, initialization, querying, and intelligent insights.

## Features

- **Database Modeling**: Leverages SQLAlchemy for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).
- **Data Seeding**: Includes scripts to initialize the database with seed data.
- **AI Integration**: Utilizes artificial intelligence for advanced analytics and recommendations.
- **Modular Design**: Separate files for models, AI logic, and main application logic.
- **Scalable**: Designed to integrate with other databases like PostgreSQL if needed.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.8+
- `pip` (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sashankpannala/calcidb.git
   cd calcidb
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   python seed_users.py
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

- Run the application using `python main.py`.
- The database (`app.db`) will be created in the project directory if it doesn't exist.
- Use `seed_users.py` to populate the database with initial user data.
- Leverage the AI module for insights and recommendations.

### Example

Here’s an example of how to interact with the database and AI features:

1. Run `main.py` to start the application.
2. Query or manipulate data through the provided interface or API.
3. Use the AI feature to generate insights by providing relevant inputs.

## Project Structure

```

├── main.py           # Main application logic
├── models.py         # Database models (SQLAlchemy ORM)
├── seed_users.py     # Script to seed database with initial data

├── requirements.txt  # Python dependencies
└── README.md         # Project documentation
```

## Future Improvements

- Add support for more database backends (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
- Expand AI capabilities for predictive analytics and natural language processing.
- Implement unit tests for core functionality.
- Provide a web-based or command-line interface for managing the database and AI features.
- Add Docker support for streamlined deployment.
